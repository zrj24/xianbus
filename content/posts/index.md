The Experimental Class in Intelligence Science and Technology, commonly known as "Zhi-Class," is a collaborative initiative by the School of Intelligence Science and Technology and the School of Electronics Engineering and Computer Science at Peking University. Building on the legacy of China's first educational program in Intelligence Science and Technology, Zhi-Class emphasizes a strong foundation in mathematics and physics, deep interdisciplinary integration of science and engineering, systematic curriculum planning, and internationally renowned faculty. The program is dedicated to cultivating the next generation of leaders in AI for China.

Zhi-Class offers a comprehensive knowledge system centered on AI, with a curriculum that covers key areas such as computer vision, natural language processing, cognitive science, robotics, machine learning, and multi-agent systems. The program advocates for science exploration guided by cutting-edge research, aiming to enhance students' scientific literacy. It also provides research-oriented courses to develop students' research capabilities, along with opportunities for international exchange, collaboration with leading experts, and peer-to-peer learning, fostering broad perspectives, teamwork, theoretical rigor, and practical skills.

Since its inception, Zhi-Class students have actively organized and participated in a variety of enrichment activities, including the [Zhi Reading Club](../tags/%E6%99%BA%E8%AF%BB/), [Zhi Talk](../tags/zhi-talk/), and [Zhi-Enterprise Bridging Program](../tags/%E5%85%B6%E4%BB%96/). These initiatives create open platforms for communication and offer advanced learning opportunities, allowing students to grow together through interaction and mutual support. We remain open and inclusive, and warmly welcome discussions and collaborations with scholars from all fields.
